Dependencies, credits, and thank you's

--- Python
Dependencies
   - PyGame : https://www.pygame.org/news

We've used PyGame for every single project this semester


--- Haskell
Dependencies
   - WAVE : https://hackage.haskell.org/package/WAVE
   WAVE made reading audio data a breeze and I could not have done anything without it
   
  - Aeson : https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-1.4.1.0
  Bryan O'Sullivan <bos@serpentine.com>
  Aeson made the generating the output and using the output much easier thanks to how easy it makes encoding JSON data
   
  - Hspec : http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspec
  Simon Hengel <sol@typeful.net>
  Hspec made testing possible and intuitive (although you don't get to see that in the project4 branch. Checkout the demo branch instead!)


--- Octave
Thank You : Octave made it incredibly easy to rapidly prototype different implementations and get both audio and visual feedback
