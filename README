Dependencies, credits, and thank you's

--- Python
Dependencies
   - PyGame : https://www.pygame.org/news

We've used PyGame for every single project this semester


--- Haskell
Dependencies
   - Data.WAVE : https://hackage.haskell.org/package/WAVE
   WAVE made reading audio data a breeze and I could not have done anything without it
   
  - Data.Aeson : https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-1.4.1.0
   Bryan O'Sullivan <bos@serpentine.com>
   Aeson made the generating the output and using the output much easier thanks to how easy it makes encoding JSON data


--- Octave
Thank You : Octave made it incredibly easy to rapidly prototype different implementations and get both audio and visual feedback
